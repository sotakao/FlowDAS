# FlowDAS: A Flow-Based Framework for Data Assimilation

This repository contains the official implementation of [FlowDAS: A Flow-Based Framework for Data Assimilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16642).

This is the first version of the code and is currently under development for extension. At this stage, we provide the implementation for the Lorenz 1963 experiment. The code for Navier-Stokes, PIV, weather forecasting (and more!) will be released soon.

This codebase is organized to make it easy to reproduce our experiments and extend the framework. Here's how to get started:

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment for FlowDAS, we provide an `environment.yml` file that contains all the necessary dependencies. You can create and activate the conda environment using the commands below. Note that after creating the environment, you'll need to install PyTorch separately to ensure compatibility with your CUDA version.


```
conda env create --file environment.yml --prefix /path/to/your/conda/env
conda activate flowdas
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```


## Experiments

### 1. Lorenz 1963

To reproduce the results from our paper for the Lorenz 1963 experiment, run: ``./scripts/run.sh``.

### 2. Navier-Stokes Equation

Coming soon!

### 3. Weather Forecasting

The dataset used in our weather forecasting experiment can be dowmloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h83pp33jx5gz62gk0gncs/sevir_lr.zip?rlkey=dtnnk6x4af0hhrneugijhq60s&st=59exx82d&dl=0). The checkpoint of our pre-trained model can be accessed [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5z1bwfdvbztnums9deqhe/latest.pt?rlkey=o5izt721am3hzkcwjmmn7joym&st=0bdrds2o&dl=0). 


## Acknowledgements

We built our repo on the [Probabilistic Forecasting with Stochastic Interpolants and FÃ¶llmer Processes](https://github.com/interpolants/forecasting) repo that is publicly available.
